This theme was made to strip away all the fancy stylesheet shenanigans and to just get back to the basics of writing. Thus, there really isn't support for a lot of crazy stuff like tables, blockquotes, codeblocks, etc. There really is just:
1. **bold**
2. *italisized*
3. ~~strikethroughs~~
4. lists

- unordered lists work as well
- [links too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future)

This theme also contains SEO tags from the Jekyll SEO gem, but in all honesty, I just wanted a simple theme that could go with just simple writing. I named this theme "Ipsum" which is derived from the Latin term "itself" because that's all there is. If you do happen to use this theme, I hope the simplicty gives you ease of mind. If not, you can always use my [other theme](https://github.com/exkcd/arctica).
